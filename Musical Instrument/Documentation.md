For this musical instrument assignment, we wanted to explore different and unique types of sensors we haven't seen in class yet. We looked around in the IM Lab and thought of all the different ways we could use the sensors available to us. Some of our options were:
- infrared sensor
- photoresistor 
- motion sensor
- force resistor
- accelerometer

We ended up using an accelerometer as our primary sensor. 

Next, we had to figure out how to we were going to wire up the accelerometer and what code could we potentially use, since the accelerometer takes more
