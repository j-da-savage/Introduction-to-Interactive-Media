For this musical instrument assignment, we wanted to explore different and unique types of sensors we haven't seen in class yet. We looked around in the IM Lab and thought of all the different ways we could use the sensors available to us. Some of our options were:
- infrared sensor
- photoresistor 
- motion sensor
- force resistor
- accelerometer

We ended up using an accelerometer as our primary sensor. 

Next, we had to figure out how to we were going to wire up the accelerometer and what code could we potentially use. After thorough research trying to find the type of accelerometer we had and trying to find the wiring/code for it, we decided to use the orientation function of the accelerometer for our instrument. 

Some of the websites that were really helpful during this process:
