My main goal with this assignment was to test out all the new functions and lines of code i've learned over the past four classes. I also wanted to practice codes using 'for',''if', and 'while', and I wanted to test their limits and be more comfortable using them.
So, as you can see in the 3 screenshots below, I tested out different versions of codes, all using different functions.

However, I did not feel like they were 'artsy' enough, so i kept creating new codes and playing with the functions i already know until I reached something I was satisfied with. I achieved the drawing below first through a few lines of code that I was simply testing (for, 'random'), however, when I saw the potential these few lines had, I started to edit them and change a few things about them until I reached the drawing below. If I were asked to analyze or interpret it, I would have to be honest and say that it's just satifying to look at. However, a few people pointed out that it looks like trees in a forest, so, i went with that, and added a sky blue background to compliment them. Hence, the name of the piece (*nature*).

N.B: If you go on the p5 link to the drawing, it will be animated.
