My inspiration for this project came when I was practicing the codes done in class, and decided to change the car examples to snowmen. To practice creating classes and using them, I coded two snowmen racing, but then decided to make them fall (I changed the x-axis to y-axis).

Then, I decided that i wanted to create a piece that was somewhat interactive, so, I created a piece that simulated falling snow. The snow changes in density and moves as the user presses on their mouse, and the petals of the flower (which represents the last standing flower in a storm), change color as the user moves their mouse accross the canvas.

I did however face many challenges while working on this code. Firstly, simulating the falling snow was difficult since I wanted it to look as realistic as possible while keeping a rather simple aspect to it. Moreover, i'd ay that the most difficult part of this code was creting the ffect of the piling up snow, and that is why i created many "functions" inside the snow class. I am certain that there is a more intuitive way of doing the same thing, and avoid creating so many arrays at the same time. 

One of my trials also included changing the color of the snow, but I did not end up doing that.
