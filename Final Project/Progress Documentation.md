**Idea 3:**
- ***Where are you from?*** also a body painting, but accumulate everyone to form a globe. or like ask many questions like:
	-   where are u from (shape of country)
	-   favorite pose
	-   how are you feeling
	-   favorite color
	-   …

**Idea 6:**
-   ***Cooking game*** , like flip steak (accelerometer) and make a meal or something (would need to add a competitive side to it though)
