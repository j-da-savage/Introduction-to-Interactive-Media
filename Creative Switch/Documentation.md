My goal with this assignment was to truly undertsand the functioning of the basic circuit we learned in class, and then to explore more creative ways to use it, and to build a creative switch. 

I first re-did the circuit done in class and tried to move some wires around to understand what each one did. Then, I moved on to the switch part of the circuit and recreated the circuit that was gonna be the base for my assignment.

I then took a piece of alimunium foil and started playing around with the wires to gain a deeper understanding of how the circuit worked, and the sensitivity of the wires... .

Next, I tried touching the wires together through different materials and objects like my laptop, my metal-frame bed, my gold bracelet... . With this, I discovered even more conductive objects around me.

I then took my guitar and started playing it using my wires and found that the LED light lit up when I touched the guitar strings. I liked this idea of music-syncing, but found that the guitar idea was too simple and I was technically using my hands for it.

That's when I came across my رق, aka: Riq.

A Riq is an instrument played accross Arab countries, but is especially an Egyptian staple, it is used in almost all festivities and occasions and symbolises joy and excitement. I love my red Riq very much and as soon as my eyes layed on its metal "jingles", I knew that I had to use it for this assignment. 

So, I first made sure that the metal on the riq was a conductive material, then I attached long pieces of foil to each of my wires connected to the LED. I then
