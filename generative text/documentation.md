For this project, my main motivation was to do something a bit different than what I have been doing thus far in this class, and since i had the chance to use text, that gave me the opportunity to send a message, or use my words for something motivational. My main inspiration was a post I saw on Pinterest, it's a quote that says: "You are not a burden. You are not too much. You are free to feel and trust. Even here, you are worthy of Love".

And since this quote really resonated with me, I decided to make it my message in this art work. Next, I got inspired by another post, or rather a whole aesthetic on Pinterest: the "multiple hearts" aesthetic:

So, I had my two main components. I just needed something that would turn my inspiration into a p5.js artwork, and that's when I remembered the moving text exercise we did in class.

So, with inspiration from that code, I made my art piece.

One of the difficulties I ran into was trying to get the text to fir on screen how i want it.

Finally, I had the idea of getting the hearts to make the shape of a heart when the mouse is pressed, but i unfortunately wasn't able to figure out the code forr it after many attempts.
