With this assignment, I personally felt a bit limited in terms of the cicuit I was going to create, especially since I only had a photoresistor as my analog input source. So, I wanted to be as creative as possible and put my circuit to good use and make it useful.

To gain a better understanding of the circuits previously done in class, I first recreated the photoresistor circuit with one LED.
