So far this week, I have worked on the structure of my game, as well as everything that's going to happen in it. I also know which lines of code I will need to create my game, but I am still in the experiment phase of that. I tried using the grid example done in class to represent my game with the different objects, obstacles , and characters, but that was quite challending because i did not feel like the grid display was the most fit for me, for this project. However, I will most probably be using a 2D array and storing objects in it accordingly. By the end of this week, I plan to have the whole structure and objects of my game up and running, so I could have time to work on the actual game play.
